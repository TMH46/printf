This is a directory created for the project printf

_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
converted for output.
upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
(excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.
